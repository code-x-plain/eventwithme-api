# Data Model

The EventWithMe API data model is built around these key components:

## Repositories

- **[src/Repository](mdc:src/Repository)**: Contains repository classes for data access

## Database Configuration

- **[config/packages/doctrine.yaml](mdc:config/packages/doctrine.yaml)**: Doctrine ORM configuration
- **[migrations](mdc:migrations)**: Database migration files

## Data Serialization

- **[config/serialization](mdc:config/serialization)**: API response serialization configuration

## Entity Relationships

The data model centers around Event entities, which connect to other entities like Users, Locations, and Registrations as the application grows.
